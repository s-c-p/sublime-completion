Sublime completion for vim

## desire

to be like sublime when it comes to auto-completion
  * fuzzy matching everywhere instead of just prefix based search,
	  this is something vim doesn't do natively
	* in human lang
		- std dictionary + user defined words in this file
		- ability to index files (by extension) in curr dir
	* in prog lang
		- show completion menu when 3 chars have been typed
		- cycle through completions using tab only
		- some smart way to exploit all kinds of completion vim provides
		  like ctag completion (intellisensey), file path completion, etc.
		  USING both implicit way (context aware, like seek preceeding `::`
		  in c++ code to know that ctag completion is what is needed) and
		  explicit way (like `<TAB-f>` for file path completion).
	* absolutely no support for anything like `full line completion`


## without any plugins

`<c-x> <c-f>` will auto complete path
